Problems with test cases:
1. Return and print statments cannot have function calls
	Ex. print myFunction(x) //Not allowed based on grammar
	Ex. return myFunction(x) //Not allowed based on grammar

Therefore 
	1. RightFibonacci.mimp will fail
	2. RighFunction.mimp will fail
	3. WrongFibonacci.mimp will fail
	4. WrongFunction.mimp will fail

2. Using 4 spaces rather then the specified \t
	Ex.
if x < 6:
    print 1
else:
    print 0

Therefore: 
	1. RightIf.mimp will fail
	2. WrongIf.mimp will fail

3. Print statements cannot print lists
	Ex. print [1,2,3]

Therefore
	1. RightList.mimp will fail
	2. WrongList.mimp will fail

Worked:
	RightWhile.mimp
	WrongWhile.mimp
