Hello,

I am very concerned about the assignment given to us over reading week. After looking over the assignment outline for Minimp I have found two problems.

For the Minimp grammar, on line 4 Arglist should as far as I can tell be MoreArgs
because doing so allows for a procedure to have multiple variables defined in it with commas separating each of them.

Also, on line 23 it should include identifier as one of the options. If this is not the case then 'expression' will only be able to be composed of integers. 

In class one of my group members Jonathan, spoke to you regarding clarification of
whitespace for indentation in Python and you mentioned that we need to support
the tab character "\t" for indentation. But in the document it mentions that the
number of spaces in indentation is variable, should we simply just support the
tab character "\t" for indentation?

I have not found any other errors yet but I am concerned that there is more and that would cause our group to lose marks for properly implementing Grammar with mistakes in it.

Thanks,
Joseph Heron
