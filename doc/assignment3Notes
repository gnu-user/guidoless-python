What was done.
- We used a stack to keep track of the temp registers used
- Implemented printing integers
	- store value in output register
	- use system call
- addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
	- pop a reg off the stack to store the answer in
	- If the first operand was a constant value, store it in a register
		- else use the register value it is already in
	- add it to the other operand (it doesnt matter whether this is value is a register or a actual integer value)
 	- return the name of the reg value
- Implemented varaible storing, printing
	- create a data value of the variable <name>_<scope#>
	- return the variable's name
- Implemented using variables in arithmatic operations
	- load variable into memory
	- return temp memory address
- all comparison operations
	- similar to addition operations
	- return address of reg that stores 0 or 1 (false or true respectively)
- Implemented printing boolean
	- Make so that boolean return addresses would be reconized, and would print out the stored 'true' (if address stores 1) or the stored 'false' (if address stores 0)
- Implemented Lists printing
	- Returns a list of elements to print out
	- iterates through the list to print out the elements
- if statements
	- creates a incremeting label (increments per instance of 'if') 
	- the condition will evaulate and jump to the else_<instance count> if the condition is false (0)
	- at the end of the if body a statement will be added to jump past the else body
	- the else statement starts with the lable else_<instance_count>
	- after the end of the else body a lable will be created for the if to jump to after finishing execution.
- while statements
	- similar to the if statement.
	- starts with a incremeting label defined as while_<instance_count>
	- condition will jump to the end of the while body if false (0)
	- the very last statement of the while will jump to the while_<instance_count>

What needs to be done.
	- Clean up so that attempts made to use functions or returns will result in an error thrown.
